# Exploring a Timeless Problem Through a Novel Lens: Happiness v.s. GDP

### Motivation
Happiness levels are correlated with societal metrics such as crime rate, birth rate, economic growth, and education levels. Policy makers, consequently, often use happiness as a basis for making policy changes. I believe this topic is of particular importance in studying governmental policies and related social implications of these policies, as the ultimate goal of a nation is to increase not only economic well-being, but also mental and physical welfare of its citizens.

**Understanding the causal relationship between changes in the happiness of a nation's citizens and changes in that nation's GDP per capita can allow governing bodies to make data-driven decisions regarding post-pandemic recovery policies towards both the economy and the well-being of their citizens.**

### Literature
There have been numerous studies over the years on happiness vs GDP, with students and experts alike analyzing data in search of an answer to the causal relationship between these two variables. I draw inspiration from some of these previous studies.

The genesis of happiness and GDP stems from [Richard Easterlin](https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00590436/) who in 1974 attempted to explain why despite the growth of the U.S. economy, the levels of national hapiness did not rise correspondingly. Easterlin analyzed the happiness levels of many Western countries over time and saw virtually no trends for changes in happiness levels despite incomes nearly doubling over the same period of time.

Other literature results, on the other hand, show diminishing impact of GDP on Happiness. A popular theory conducted by [Proto and Rustichini](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079358) stated that the positive relation in happiness vanishes beyond some value of increasing income. They partitioned all individual observations into quantiles of per capita GDP by the country of residence (with the first quantile of the distribution containing the individuals living in the poorest countries), and then estimated the relation between GDP and happiness by using the quantiles. In their 2013 report _A Reassessment of the Relationship between GDP and Life Satisfaction_, Proto and Rustichini provided analysis supporting their main findings:

* Most of the variation of life satisfaction due to GDP is explained by the effect in countries with per capita GDP below $10,000 (data are PPP-adjusted).
* People in countries with a GDP per capita of below $6,700 were 12% less likely to report the highest level of life satisfaction than those in countries with a GDP per capita of around $20,000.
* Countries with GDP per capita over $20,000 see a much less obvious link between GDP and happiness.
* Between this level and the very highest GDP per capita level ($54,000), the probability of reporting the highest level of life satisfaction changes by no more than 2%, and seems to be hump-shaped, with a bliss point at around $33,000.
